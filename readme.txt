Star Craft 2 Bot for CMPUT 350 at Ualberta. Our bot is based on the [BasicSc2Bot](https://github.com/tuero/BasicSc2Bot) template.

# Instructions on how to obtain, compile, and run AIArmadaBot

System Requirnments:
* [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/)
* Starcraft 2 ([Windows](https://starcraft2.com/en-us/)) ([Linux](https://github.com/Blizzard/s2client-proto#linux-packages)) 
* [Starcraft 2 Map Packs](https://github.com/Blizzard/s2client-proto#map-packs), The maps we will be using are in the `Ladder 2017 Season 1` pack. Read the instructions for how to extract and where to place the maps.
* For Windows: [Visual Studio 2022](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/)

How to obtain/compile the bot:
## Windows
```bat
:: Clone the project (AIArmadaBot)
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/RylannAnd/AI_Armada
$ cd AI_Armada

:: Create build directory.
$ mkdir build
$ cd build

:: Generate VS solution.
$ cmake ../ -G "Visual Studio 17 2022"

:: Build the project using Visual Studio.
$ start AIArmadaBot.sln
```

## Mac
Note: Try opening the SC2 game client before installing. If the game crashes before opening, you may need to change your Share name:
* Open `System Preferences`
* Click on `Sharing`
* In the `Computer Name` textfield, change the default 'Macbook Pro' to a single word name (the exact name shouldn't matter, as long as its not the default name)

To build, you must use the version of clang that comes with MacOS. 
```bat
:: Clone the project (AIArmadaBot)
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/RylannAnd/AI_Armada
$ cd AI_Armada

:: Create build directory.
$ mkdir build
$ cd build

:: Set Apple Clang as the default compiler
export CC=/usr/bin/clang
export CXX=/usr/bin/clang++

:: Generate a Makefile
:: Use 'cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ../' if debug info is needed
$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ../

:: Build
$ make
```

## Linux
The Linux version is headless, meaning that you will not be able to see your bot 
First, download the [Linux package](https://github.com/Blizzard/s2client-proto#linux-packages).
Unzip it to your home directory. 
The directory should read as `/home/<USER>/StarCraftII/`.

Rename the `Maps` directory to lowercase, and place any downloaded maps inside this directory:
```bash
$ mv /home/<USER>/StarCraftII/Maps /home/<USER>/StarCraftII/maps
```

Finally, create a directory (note the added space) which contains a file `ExecuteInfo.txt`, which lists the executable directory:
```bash
$ mkdir "/home/<USER>/StarCraft II"
$ echo "executable = /home/<USER>/StarCraftII/Versions/Base75689/SC2_x64" > "/home/<USER>/StarCraft II/ExecuteInfo.txt"
```
The `Base75689` will need to match the correct version which matches the version you downloaded. To check, navigate to `/home/<USER>/StarCraftII/Versions/`.

Remember to replace `<USER>` with the name of your user profile.

How to run the bot against the built-in AI:
You can find the build target under the `bin` directory. Can be run like the following example:
```
# Windows
./AIArmadaBot.exe -c -a zerg -d Hard -m CactusValleyLE.SC2Map

# Mac
./AIArmadaBot -c -a zerg -d Hard -m CactusValleyLE.SC2Map
```
